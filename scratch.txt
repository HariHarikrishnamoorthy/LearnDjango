1) check version
    1) python -m django --version

2) start project a new Project
    1) django-admin startproject {{project name}}
       * {{project name}} is root folder
       * manage.py command-line utility, interact django with project


3) run server python server
    1) python manage.py runserver (default port : 8000)
    2) python manage.py runserver {{port number}} (custom port)
    3) python manage.py runserver {{ip address:port number}} (custom ip :custom port)
        to allow all the hosts to access the site edit {{project name}}\settings.py  Line no : 28 as ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
        or just add the host ip address

4) Start django app (application)
    1) python manage.py startapp {{app-name}}
            in {{new-app}}/veiws.py create a response
            to call the above view we need to map it to url in {{project name}}\urls.py
                for it :
                    create a urls.py in {{app-name}} in current app
                        in urls.py import [path from django.urls] and current app's view
                        then create a list called 'urlpatterns' then add all views in views.py
                            eg :- path('', views.index, name='index'),

            then next steps is to add current app's url to {{project name}}\urls.py
                for it :
                    import include [include from django.urls]
                    then add path to {{project name}}\urls.py
                    eg :- path('polls/', include('polls.urls'))

      include() is a function allows referencing other URLSconfs whenever django encounters include() functions
      chops off whatever part of urls match

      path() function takes two values default [route, view] and options values [kwargs , name]

            route - url pattern , when processing requests django starts at 1st patten in 'urlpatterns' in urls.py
                    it does not search for GET or POST parameter
            view - when django find matching pattern it calls the specified view function in views.py
                   with an HttpRequest first argument
            name - naming URLS lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates.
            this powerful feature allows you to make global changes to the URL patterns of your project while only touching a
            single file .
